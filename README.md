### Finding the minimum value in an array
This program prompts the user to input the size of an array ```n``` and then takes in ```n``` number of integers to populate an array ```arr```. 
It then calls the ```findMinimum``` function to determine the minimum value in the array and prints it to the console.

### Functionality
The program takes the following steps:

1) Prompt the user to input the size of the array ```n```.

2) Take in ```n``` number of integers to populate the array ```arr```.

3) Call the ```findMinimum``` function to determine the minimum value in the array.

4) Print the minimum value to the console.

The ```findMinimum``` function takes in an integer array ```arr``` and returns the minimum value in the array. If the array is empty, it throws an exception.

### Error Handling
If the input array is empty, the program will throw an exception with the message "n must be greater than 0".

### The program is written in Java and consists of two functions, main and findAverage.

Function: ```main```

The ```main``` function is the entry point of the program. 
It prompts the user to input the size of the array and the array elements, 
creates an array with the user-specified size, 
calls the findAverage function to calculate the average of the array elements, 
and then displays the result to the user.


Function: ```findAverage```

The ```findAverage``` function takes an integer array as input and returns the average of its elements. 
If the array is empty, it throws an exception.

Parameters - 
```arr```: An integer array containing the array elements.

Returns - 
```double```: The average of the array elements.

Exceptions - 
```Exception```: If the input array is empty.

### Determining if a Number is Prime
This program prompts the user to input a number ```n```, and then determines whether the number is prime or composite using the ```isPrime``` function. 
If the number is prime, the program outputs ```Prime```. If it is composite, the program outputs ```Composite```.
